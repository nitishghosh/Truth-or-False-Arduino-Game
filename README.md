Code by - NITISH GHOSH
Finished developing - August 24, 2020

This program is a simple logic game ideally for people who are learning digital electronics.
The players will choose between 4 different digital circuits,
and what inputs to enter into the circuit.
The goal of each player is to enter the inputs in such a way,
that the output of the circuit will result in their corresponding truth value.
The player with more points at the end wins the game.
Future versions may include different circuits/additional options.

Circuit 1: A*B+(~C+D)
Circuit 2: (~A+~B)*(C*~D))
Circuit 3: A XOR B
Circuit 4: A XNOR B
